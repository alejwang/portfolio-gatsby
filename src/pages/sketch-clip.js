          Sketch Clip is a tool designed for Sketch users to create and manage file versions in an elegant way. Designers can use this tool to undo or redo their changes, and to collaborate with coworkers.

      <ChapterTitle>overview</ChapterTitle>
      <SectionTitle>Without an optimized version control tool, UX designers have difficulties in both organizing their own sketch files and keeping files received from other designers up to date.<br/> Therefore, I designed Sketch Clip! <br/> Sketch Clip = Github for designers <br/> = version control in one place + seamless collaborate experience</SectionTitle>
    </Section>

{/* video shows how it works */}

{/* How do users use Sketch Clip? For an individual use, HCI student Crystal uses Sketch Clip to organize her design files in one place and look for any version easily. Also in a design group using Sketch Clip, the manager Alexander can follow the projectâ€™s design traces, put all the group files in one place and improve the team efficiency by checking auto change-log and solving conflict among different changes with merge feature.
What can Sketch Clip do? Manage versions and branches on cloud, generate change- log, import local files by one click, and collaborate with the others using a Sketch plugin. */}

        The final version workflow diagram showing all components we use and reuse, and all details about parameters in designs. This diagram benefits the communication between designer and developer, and another platform team.

        Since the work flow chart covers all the pages and components, it's easy for future usage - when another city use this feature with unique needs, developers only need to set some parameters for current interface and add some single pages.

      <SectionTitle>What I learned, <br />experienced, and experimented</SectionTitle>
      <StepContainerGroup>
        <StepNo>01</StepNo>
        <StepTitle>Think broader and broader <br /> for the user spectrum</StepTitle>
        <StepText>Design for both key user cases and lost of edge cases from more than 300,000+ users. Think how user access the new product/service and how it can take advantage of the existing resources - created the user spectrum for wider possibilities, even for potential users who can only see a poster with a QR code. Because to transfer current users or poster ad receivers to the new product/service easier is also an important design goal.</StepText>

      <StepContainerGroup>
        <StepNo>02</StepNo>
        <StepTitle>Give me a fulcrum <br /> and I will convince the stakeholders</StepTitle>
        <StepText>The fulcrum is design decisions driven by research, company culture or big data. We are not convincing ourselves and be a fancy guy on Dribbble. Instead, we are facing huge external resistance - from clients and different developer teams (project team, API team, security team in one project maybe!). I learned to make the right design decisions and use it to convince other people - how our design goals can inheritance from business goals, how we will track the design quality, how many potential users one feature is facing, etc. Sometimes, to finish a convincing draft efficiently with stakeholders is way more important than keeping your sketch file not dirty.</StepText>

        <StepNo>03</StepNo>
        <StepTitle>Breakthrough the mindset <br /> and chase for excellence</StepTitle>
        <StepText>"If you work in a textbook style, you may never reach excellence in a limited time". - my mentor <br/><br/>
        It's necessary to always be creative and not be limited by tools. I worked on flexible card prototyping for complex IA designs, paper prototyping for motion designs, and made developer-must-love-it pseudo-algorithm flowcharts for an institution solution project. You know what... they loved it!</StepText>
